select trim(' ' from '                My Name is Adam                      ') from dual;


select trim(BOTH ' ' from '                My Name is Adam                      ') from dual;


select trim(LEADING ' ' from '                My Name is Adam                      ') from dual;



select trim(TRAILING ' ' from '                My Name is Adam                      ') from dual;


select trim(TRAILING 'm' from '                My Name is Adam                      ') from dual;  ----The last charecter is space 


select trim(TRAILING 'm' from ' My Name is Adam') from dual;


select trim(TRAILING 'm' from ' My Name is Adammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm') from dual;


select trim(LEADING 'm' from 'my Name is Adammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm') from dual;


select trim(BOTH 'm' from 'my Name is Adammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm') trimmed_text from dual;


select trim( 'm' from 'my Name is Adammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm') trimmed_text from dual;


select trim( 'm' from 'my Name is Ada') trimmed_text from dual;

select trim( TRAILING 'm' from 'my Name is Ada') trimmed_text from dual;



select trim( TRAILING 'my' from 'my Name is Ada') trimmed_text from dual; --gives error saying trim set should have only one parameter

select ltrim( '       my Name is Adam            ') trimmed_text from dual; -- trims the space before the string


select ltrim( 'my Name is Adam','my') trimmed_text from dual;

--output is
 Name is Adam


select rtrim( 'my Name is Adam','my') trimmed_text from dual; --trims the charecter individually if it finds 

--o/p----
my Name is Ada



select rtrim( 'my Name is Adammmmmmmmmmmmmmmm','my') trimmed_text from dual;

--o/p----
my Name is Ada
