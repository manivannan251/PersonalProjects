1) SYSDATE - returns the curr date and time of OS where db is installed
2) CURRENT_DATE - returns the date and time of the place where the user's session is logged in from
3) SESSIONTIMEZONE - returns timezone of user's session
4) SYSTIMESTAMP - returns the date and time of the database and retruns fractional seconds along with timezone
5) CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - returns the curent date and time from user's session and fractional seconds along with timezone

select current_date,sysdate,sessiontimezone,current_timestamp,systimestamp from dual;

o/p from office db

Arithmetic Operations with date
1) Since Oracle stores date as numbers internally we can add or subtract a number on date and the result will also be a date

select sysdate,sysdate+3 from dual;
o/p
sysdate  sysdate+3
05-06-21  08-06-21

if we need to add 1 hour 
select sysdate,sysdate+1/24 from dual;
o/p
sysdate  	   sysdate+1/24
05-06-21 23:18:14  06-06-21 00:18:14


if we need to add 1 minute
select sysdate,sysdate+1/(24*60) from dual;
o/p
sysdate  	   sysdate+1/24
05-06-21 23:19:22  05-06-21 23:20:22

2) subtracting two dates returns the nuber of days between them
select employee_id,hire_date,sysdate,trunc(sysdate-hire_date) working_days from employees;

select employee_id,hire_date,sysdate,trunc((sysdate-hire_date)/365) working_years from employees order by working_years desc;
